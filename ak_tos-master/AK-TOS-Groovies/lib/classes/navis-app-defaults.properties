######################  Hazelcast (used by hazelcast-config.xml, Hazelcast configuration)

# The hazelcast properties are read as strings. So, any unassigned expected property holder will be considered an empty string.
# If a null is desired, set the property as 'null', but whether 'null' is acceptable for a certain expected property holder
# is up to the api property as parsed by the application.
# For string properties, the case of an empty string or null may be ignored, but if the property is defined as a number,
# the configuration parsing most likely will fail.
# Also, any property referred to in the configuration file that is not defined in any of the .properties files will generate an error upon
# configuration parsing.
